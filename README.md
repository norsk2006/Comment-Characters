# Comment-Characters
Counts the total number of commented characters in a file, including whitespaces.

Comments are started either started with // and end with a new line, or are between /* and */

Does not count the // and /* and */ as characters. Only counts what is after // or between /* and */

Example: //This is a comment

If this were the only comment in the file, then there would be a total of 17 characters.
